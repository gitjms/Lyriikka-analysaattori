  <p class="lead">
	Analyze songs' word frequencies.
	
	<hr />
	
	Default user roles are 'admin' and 'guest'.<br>
	
	You may play with admin and guest accounts and 	see what they are able to do.<br><br>
	
	<li>username: admin, password: admin</li>
	<li>username: guest, password: guest</li><br>
	
	
	If you start the app for the first time, there are no songs
	in the database.
	At that point you can add your own songs or
	a small bunch of default songs.<br>

	Default songs can be added when you login as admin.
	Then you will see a button in the lower right side of the window
	(<i>Add default songs</i>) with which the songs and authors will be filled into the database.<br>

	You may also create your own account via registration (create account).<br>
	
	At the moment you are able to create, edit, and delete songs, sort them, and make quick word searches, which
	give you basic frequency analyses.
