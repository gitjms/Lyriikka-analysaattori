Lord I Need You
Matt Maher
[V1]
 Lord, I come, I confess
 Bowing here I find my rest
 Without You I fall apart
 You're the One that guides my heart

[C1]
   Lord, I need You, oh, I need You
   Every hour I need You
   My one defense, my righteousness
   Oh God, how I need You

[V2]
 Where sin runs deep Your grace is more
 Where grace is found is where You are
 Where You are, Lord, I am free
 Holiness is Christ in me

[B1]
   So teach my song to rise to You
   When temptation comes my way
   When I cannot stand I'll fall on You
   Jesus,...
