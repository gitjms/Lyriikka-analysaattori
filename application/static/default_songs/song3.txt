Let the Lower Lights Be Burning
Philip Paul Bliss
[V1]
 Brightly beams our Father's mercy from His lighthouse evermore,
 But to us He gives the keeping, of the lights along the shore
 Let the lower lights be burning! Send a gleam a cross the wave!
 For to us He gives the keeping of the lights along the shore.

[V2]
 Dark the night of sin has settled, loud the angry billows roar.
 Eager eyes are watching, longing, for the lights, along the shore
 Let the lower lights be burning! Send a gleam a cross the wave!
 For to us He gives the keeping of the lights along the shore.

[V3]
 Trim your feeble lamp, my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed,
 Trying now to make the harbor, in the darkness may be lost.
 Let the lower lights be burning! Send a gleam a cross the wave!
 Trying now to make the harbor, some poor sailor may be lost.
